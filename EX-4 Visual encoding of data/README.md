# Experiment 4 – Visual Encoding of Data

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates effective visual encoding principles to communicate traffic accident data. The R programming language is used to encode accident severity with colors, represent accident frequency using point size, and indicate accident types using shapes.

## Experiment Details
- **Experiment No:** 4  
- **Title:** Visual Encoding of Data  
- **Language:** R  
- **Dataset:** `4.traffic_accidents.csv`  

## Objective
To apply effective visual encoding techniques for meaningful data visualization and communication.

## Scenario
A city traffic department analyzes accident records to identify high-risk zones and patterns of accident severity, supporting better traffic management and safety decisions.

## Tools & Libraries
- **ggplot2** – For data visualization  
- **dplyr** – For data manipulation  

## In-Lab Tasks
- Encode accident severity using color (Minor → Green, Major → Orange, Fatal → Red)  
- Represent accident frequency/casualties using point size  
- Represent accident type using different shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square)  
- Create a scatter plot visualizing accidents by location and number of vehicles involved  

## Visual Output
- Scatter plot showing:
  - **X-axis:** Accident Location  
  - **Y-axis:** Vehicles Involved  
  - **Color:** Severity (Minor, Major, Fatal)  
  - **Size:** Number of Casualties  
  - **Shape:** Accident Type (Collision, Rollover, Pedestrian)  

## Key Observations
- Color effectively conveys accident severity at a glance  
- Larger points highlight accidents with more casualties  
- Shapes help distinguish different types of accidents without relying on color alone  
- Visual encoding allows quick identification of high-risk zones and patterns  

## Files Included
- `4.traffic_accidents.csv` – Traffic accident dataset  
- R script (`Exp4_VisualEncoding.R`) – Code for visualization  
- Screenshot of the scatter plot output  

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates how proper visual encoding can transform raw data into easily interpretable visual insights. Effective use of color, size, and shape allows quick identification of high-risk areas, supporting data-driven decisions in traffic safety.
