# Experiment 3 – Designing Multivariate Patterns

## Overview

This experiment demonstrates the use of **multivariate visualization techniques** to analyze healthcare data and identify relationships among multiple health indicators. The experiment uses the **R programming language** to generate a scatter plot matrix, apply color encoding for age groups, and identify correlated health indicators.

## Experiment Details

* **Experiment No:** 3
* **Title:** Designing Multivariate Patterns
* **Language Used:** R
* **Dataset:** `3.healthcare_data.csv`

---

## Objective

To discover relationships among multiple variables using multivariate visualization techniques.

---

## Scenario

A hospital analytics team analyzes patient health records to identify relationships between age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels for early disease prediction.

---

## Tools & Libraries

The following R libraries are used in this experiment:

* `GGally` – for scatter plot matrix (`ggpairs`)
* `dplyr` – for data manipulation

---

## In-Lab Tasks

The following tasks were performed:

1. Generated a **scatter plot matrix** of health indicators
2. Applied **color encoding** based on patient age groups
3. Identified **correlated health indicators** using correlation analysis

---

## Visual Output

* A scatter plot matrix displaying relationships among:

  * Age
  * Blood Pressure
  * Cholesterol
  * Glucose Level
* Different colors represent different **age groups** (Young, Middle, Senior)

---

## Correlation Analysis

A correlation matrix was computed to quantify relationships between health indicators. The analysis showed:

* Positive correlation between **Age and Blood Pressure**
* Moderate correlation between **Cholesterol and Glucose Level**
* Weak correlation between **Age and Glucose Level**

---

## Key Observations

* Multivariate visualization helps reveal hidden patterns in healthcare data
* Age is an important factor influencing multiple health indicators
* Scatter plot matrices are effective for exploratory data analysis

---

## Files Included

* `3.healthcare_data.csv` – Healthcare dataset
* R script containing code for visualization and analysis
* Screenshots of:

  * R code
  * Scatter plot matrix output
  * Correlation matrix output

---

## Conclusion

This experiment successfully demonstrates how multivariate visualization techniques can be used to analyze complex healthcare datasets. The use of scatter plot matrices and correlation analysis provides valuable insights that support data-driven decision-making in healthcare analytics.
