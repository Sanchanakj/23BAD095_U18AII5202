# 📊 Experiment 5: Dashboard Designing using Power BI

## Overview
This experiment focuses on designing an **interactive analytical dashboard** to monitor key academic metrics such as **attendance, performance, and department-wise insights**. The dashboard is built using **Power BI** and demonstrates how visual analytics support decision-making in a smart campus environment.

---

## Objective
To design an interactive dashboard that visualizes and monitors:
- Student attendance
- Academic performance
- Department-wise and semester-wise insights  

---

## Problem Statement / Scenario
An **AI-based Smart Campus System** requires a dashboard to:
- Track attendance and academic performance in real time  
- Compare departments and semesters  
- Support data-driven decision-making for administrators  

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and visualization  
- **CSV Dataset** – Student performance and attendance data  
- **Data Cleaning & Aggregation** – For KPI calculations  

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information related to:
- Student ID  
- Department (AI&DS, CSE, IT)  
- Semester  
- Attendance Percentage  
- Academic Performance  

> Dataset file: `student_performance.csv`

---

## Dashboard Features
### 🔹 KPI Cards
- Total number of students  
- Average performance score  
- Average attendance percentage  

### 🔹 Visualizations
- **Bar Chart**: Average performance by department  
- **Bar Chart**: Attendance percentage by department  
- **Pie Chart**: Attendance distribution across departments  

### 🔹 Filters & Interactivity
- Semester filter  
- Department filter  
- Cross-visual interaction for drill-down analysis  

---

## Key Insights
- Departments can be compared based on performance and attendance  
- Attendance trends vary significantly across departments  
- Interactive filters enable deeper analysis instead of static views  

---

## Pre-Lab Concepts Covered
- Role of dashboards in strategic decision-making  
- Importance of interactivity in dashboards  
- KPI derivation from raw data  
- Cognitive overload issues in dashboard design  

---

## Post-Lab Learnings
- Interactivity improves analytical depth  
- KPIs like attendance %, average marks, and pass rate are critical  
- Clean layout and minimal visuals prevent information overload  
- Dashboards can be integrated with AI alerts for anomaly detection
