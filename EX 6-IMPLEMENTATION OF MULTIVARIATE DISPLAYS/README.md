# 📊 Experiment 6: Implementation of Multivariate Displays

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates the use of **multivariate visualization techniques** to analyze complex retail data. Using the **R programming language**, multiple variables such as **Sales, Profit, Discount, and Region** are visualized simultaneously to identify patterns, relationships, and insights useful for business analytics and AI-driven decision-making.

---

## Objective
To implement advanced **multivariate displays** for analyzing complex datasets and understanding relationships among multiple variables.

---

## Problem Scenario
A **retail analytics firm** analyzes sales performance across regions to:
- Study relationships between sales, profit, and discounts  
- Compare performance across regions  
- Support business optimization strategies  

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **R Programming Language**
- **ggplot2**
- **GGally**
- **Retail Dataset (CSV)**

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains retail transaction details including:
- Order ID  
- Sales  
- Profit  
- Discount  
- Region  

> Dataset file: `retail_business.csv`

## Visualizations Implemented

### 🔹 Parallel Coordinate Plot
- Displays multiple variables on parallel axes  
- Each observation is represented as a line  
- Helps identify trends, correlations, and outliers across dimensions

---

### 🔹 Bubble Chart (Sales vs Profit)
- X-axis: Sales  
- Y-axis: Profit  
- Bubble size: Sales magnitude  
- Bubble color: Region  
- Useful for identifying high-profit and low-profit regions

---

### 🔹 Trellis Display (Facet Plot by Region)
- Separate panels for each region  
- Shows Sales vs Profit relationship  
- Enables easy comparison across regions

## Key Insights
- Parallel coordinate plots reveal multi-variable patterns and anomalies  
- Bubble charts highlight regional profit distribution and sales magnitude  
- Trellis displays simplify complex data through regional segmentation  

---

## Pre-Lab Concepts Covered
- Importance of multivariate visualization in AI analytics  
- Difference between parallel coordinates and scatter plots  
- Challenges in interpreting multivariate plots  
- Use of trellis displays in business analytics  

---

## Post-Lab Learnings
- Multivariate displays enhance pattern recognition  
- Faceting improves interpretability of complex data  
- Bubble charts require careful design to avoid clutter  
- These visualizations support AI-driven recommendations
